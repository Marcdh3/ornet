**OrNet** is a python pipeline for analyzing fluorescence microscopy imagery of mitochondrial protein patterns.

*Mitochondria in a single cell, with red flourescent tagging* 

## Purpose
Analyzing the morphological changes organelles undergo after exposure to external stimul is significant because some structures offer crucial insight into the manner in which human cells responds to viral or bacterial infections. This framework is intended to mitigate the need for manual inspection of flouresence microscopy videos to identify time points and frame regions where significant changes are occurring. Our framework is defined by three key components -- cell segmentation, graph construction, and spectral analysis.

## Dependencies
**Required packages:** 
The complete list of required packages are described in the [requirements.txt](https://github.com/quinngroup/ornet/blob/master/requirements.txt) file.

**Python version:**
This software has been tested on python versions 3.6 - 3.8.

## Installation
Inside of the root directory of this project run:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install .
```

This installation process should install all of the required dependencies.
In the event that some of the packages are not installed properly,
please refer to the dependencies section and manually install all that are listed.

## Testing
Inside of the "tests" sub-directory, run the following command:

```
python tests.py
```

7 tests, from various checkpoints along the pipeline, should run without any failures.

## Pipeline Outline

<img src="img/pipeline_diagram.png" width="1000">

**Inputs:**

- A single time-series video where the cells are fluorescently tagged to aid in the detection of sub-cellular organisms. (Note: We used a red fluorescent protein, DsRed2-Mito-7, in our experiments.)  
- An initial segmentation mask that denotes the location of each cell in the first frame, saved in the (.itk) format. (Documentation for the ITK-Snap tool we used to generate our masks can be found [here](http://www.itksnap.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php?n=Documentation.SNAP3).)

The **pipeline** is composed of 7 tasks:

1. Constraining the video (Optional)
2. Tracking cell movements
3. Median Normalize each video frame
4. Downsampling the video (Optional)
5. Extract individual cells
6. Computing GMM intermediates
7. Computing distance metrics

**Outputs**:

The output will be a directory of the following structure:
```
├── outputs/
│   ├── singles/
│   ├── intermediates/
│   ├── distances/
```

The singles sub-directory will contain the individual videos (.avi) of each extracted cell from the original video, 
intermediates contain compressed numpy files (.npz) that store the means, covariances, weights, and precisions
matrices generated by the gaussian mixture model (GMM), and the distances directory contains numpy files (.npy) that represent the divergence metrics between components of the GMM.

## Usage

Ornet can be utilized from either the command line interface or in a script.

**Command Line Interface:**
```
python -m ornet -i <input video or directory> -m <mask directory> -o <output directory> -c <constrain count>
```

For more detailed information regarding the command line options, use the "-h" flag.

```
python -m ornet -h
```

**Python script:**
```
from ornet import pipeline as pipeline

pipeline.run(input_path, mask_path, output_path)
```
